Sleep= now that you are going to be training consistently it is important that you rest at least seven to eight hours a night in order to get the best results 

Consistency= now that you have taken your online assessment we have provided you with the program that we feel best matches your level of training. Stick with it and don’t give up!

Healthy eating= Training is just one part of the equation you need the right fuel to back up your training. Make sure you take advantage of all the balance recipes designed by our professional chefs.

Education= Make sure you go through all of the different articles we provide so you can continue to learn about the human body and how it responds to exercise. You don’t only want to train hard you also want to train smart
