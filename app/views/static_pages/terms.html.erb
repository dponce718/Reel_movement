<h3>Payments Auto billing Subscription Fees Free Trial Terms</h3>
<p>
 The Reel Movement Service is a paid, auto-renewing subscription service. If you purchase a subscription by accepting our Free Trial offer, you are agreeing to automatic (recurring) billing, and agree to pay the charges made to your account in connection therewith. Your Subscription, and monthly billing of your account, will continue indefinitely until cancelled by you.
</p>
<p>
Your Reel Movement membership begins when you have completed the Free Trial sign-up process (i.e., when we collect your personal and payment information). At the end of your 14-day Free Trial, you will begin to be billed automatically each month (about every 30 days) until you cancel. Once we begin to bill you, cancellations take effect starting at the end of your current billing period, meaning there are no partial month refunds or credits. If you cancel your Free Trial membership at anytime in the first fourteen days (i.e., during the Free Trial period), you will not be charged.
</p>

<p>
The pricing of our Services may vary periodically. We cannot guarantee that the price of your Subscription is the lowest available, or historically lowest or best, price. You will be charged in accordance with the billing terms you agreed to at the time you signed up.
</p>

<h3> HOW TO CANCEL </h3>

<p>
If you do not wish for your account to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, log into your account, and follow the instructions from the Account Settings page.
</p>

<p>
Your cancellation will take effect starting at the end of your current billing period and you will continue to have access to your account through the account expiration date. So, for example, if you have a monthly subscription that began on the first of the month but cancel mid-month, your cancellation will take effect as of the beginning of the following month. There are no refunds on Reel Movement subscriptions for billing periods that have already lapsed.
</p>

<p>
<span class="light-acta-book">Authorization: </span> When you sign up for our Service and provide a payment method to Reel Movement, you are granting your express consent and are expressly authorizing us (and our designated payment processor) to automatically charge you each month for the Service. 
</p>

<p>
If you provide a payment method and our charge results in an overdraft, chargeback or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.
</p>

<p>
EVEN IF YOU DO NOT USE THE SUBSCRIPTION OR ACCESS THE REEL MOVEMENT APPLICATION, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION FEES UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION OR IT IS OTHERWISE TERMINATED. 
</p>

<p>

<span class="light-acta-book">Changes: </span> Reel Movement may change, modify, add, remove, suspend, cancel or discontinue any aspect of it subscriptions including the functionality, content, and/or availability of any features of such subscriptions at any time in Reel Movement's sole discretion.  Reel Movement may increase its fees for any subscription effective the first day of a billing renewal by giving you notice of the new fees at least thirty (30) days before you are billed. If you do not cancel your subscription, you will be deemed to have accepted the new fees.

<h3>General Provisions </h3>
<p>

<span class="light-acta-book">ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW: </span>
The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, or the Site shall be binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association. The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an individual claim against Reel Movement in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction. But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any circumstances commence or maintain against Reel Movement or its affiliates any class action, class arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.

</p>

<p>
By using the Site or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above arbitration agreement. In doing so, you give up your right to go to court to assert or defend any claims between you and Reel Movement or its affiliates (except for matters that may be taken to small-claims court). You also give up your right to participate in a class action or other class proceeding. Your rights will be determined by a neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury. You are entitled to a fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
</p>

<p>
Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against Reel Movement (except for small-claims court actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in New York County, New York. You hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes and you irrevocably waive any right to a trial by jury.
</p>

<p>
This Agreement, and any dispute between you and Reel Movement, shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law, provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.

</p>

<p>
<span class="light-acta-book">INTERPRETATION; SEVERABILITY; WAIVER; REMEDIES: </span> Headings are for convenience only and shall not be used to construe the terms of this Agreement. If any term of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be severed from this Agreement. No failure or delay by Reel Movement in exercising any right hereunder will waive any further exercise of that right. Reel Movement's rights and remedies hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive.

</p>
<p>

<span class="light-acta-book">SUCCESSORS; ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES: </span> This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of both parties and their respective successors, heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, and permitted assigns. You may not assign this Agreement without Reel Movement's prior written consent. No third party shall have any rights hereunder.
</p>

<p>
<span class="light-acta-book">NOTICES: </span> You consent to receive all communications including notices, agreements, disclosures, or other information from Reel Movement electronically. Reel Movement may provide all such communications by email or by posting them on the Reel Movement Service. For support-related inquiries, you may send an email to <a href="mailto:info@reelmovement.com">info@reelmovement.com.</a>

Nothing herein shall limit Reel Movement's right to object to subpoenas, claims, or other demands.
</p>

<p>
<span class="light-acta-book">MODIFICATION: </span> This Agreement may not be modified except by a revised Terms of Service posted by Reel Movement on the Reel Movement Site or a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of Reel Movement. A revised Terms of Service will be effective as of the date it is posted on the Reel Movement Site.
</p>

<p>
