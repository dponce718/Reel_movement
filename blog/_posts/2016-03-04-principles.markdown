<p>
We all have been in a position where we want to get in better shape but we just have no idea where to begin. At Reel Movement you will not only train hard but you will also train smart. That means getting a better understanding of the human body and how it responds to exercise. To better understand how the body reacts to exercise we need to breakdown some basic principles of training. 
</p>

<h2>Principle of overload </h2>

<p>
The body constantly adapts to the pressure that is exerted on it. If you intend to continue to see training adaptations you must place additional stress on the body. For example, you can increasing the intensity of an exercise by decreasing rest time, adding additional weight, or progressing from a level 1 program to a level 2 program. It is important that you understand that the intensity should be raised progressively and cautiously in order to prevent overtraining.
</p>

<h2>Principle of Specificity</h2>

<p>
The body adapts to the specific demand placed on it. For, example you should not expect to lift heavier weights by running three miles. You should expect to improve at running three miles. If your goal is to improve your cardiovascular system that running is a good approach but if your goal is to improve lean muscle mass resistance training would be the best option. You should include different types of training because that all offer unique adaptations.
</p>

<h2>Principle of Individualization</h2>

<p>
We are all individuals and thus we have to take into account each person’s response to exercise. There is no exercise program that can be prescribed for everyone. Understanding your body is a key principle of training smart. For instance, you may need to remain at a level 1 program for slightly longer than another individual or you may progress faster than another individual. Once you become conscious of your own body you will continue to progress safely and efficiently.
