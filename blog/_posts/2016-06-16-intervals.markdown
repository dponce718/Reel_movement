<p> Interval training is really just one way to perform cardiovascular endurance training. Cardiovascular training is any type of exercise that improves the aerobic efficiency of the human body. Meaning, this type of training improves the ability of the lungs to take in oxygen, transfer it to the blood, and ultimately deliver that oxygen to the working muscles in order to aid in the production of energy. This type of exercise has many benefits, including the ability to perform cardiovascular training in a short amount of time and aiding in weight loss and management. A cardiovascular endurance program will aid weight loss as long as it is properly structured and accompanied by healthy eating habits.</p> 

<p> There are many different methods of cardiovascular training: such long slow distance running, pace/tempo training, fartlek training, and interval training. Despite these entire different methods, interval training has become quite popular, but what is interval training?</p>

<p>  Basically, interval training involves training at an intensity that is as close to your VO2max as possible. For example, an individual with a good cardiovascular base may perform a sprint at maximum capacity, about 85-95% their max heart rate, for a 30 seconds then go back down to 70-80 percent of their max heart rate for 1 minute. They may continue to cycle at this rate for about 5-15 minutes, which, is very intense on the body. This is not the only way to perform interval training rather it is just a simplistic method of breaking it down. The reason it has become so popular is because it can be done in a relatively short amount of time and it has the potential to burn more calories from fat which of course will aid in weight management. </p>

<p>Although, when an individual performs intervals it becomes relatively easy to over train the body with such an intense activity. So, ample rest and adequate nutritional intake is necessary between each session of interval training in order to ensure maximum performance and reduce the risk of injury. </p>
