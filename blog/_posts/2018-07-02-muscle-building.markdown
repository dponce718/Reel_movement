<p> Designing a personalized nutrition program can be extremely complicated because everyone has various backgrounds, genders, and cultures. Which means there is no cookie cutter diet that fits everyone. So, creating a diet for anyone can be particularly challenging. </p>


<p>Nevertheless, there are some solid tips I can give you to build some solid muscle.</p>

<h2> 1. Calculate Your Energy Requirements</h2>

<p> Everyone knows in order to build some lean muscle you are going to have to eat. I mean you are going to have to eat a lot, but the goal isn't to eat an exuberant amount of food. This is going to cause you to add plenty of body fat (I know you don't want that). So, lets build some lean muscle.</p>

<h3>But How Much Calories Should I Take in</h3>



<p> There are three things determine your daily energy requirement: </p>

<ul>

  <li>Basal metabolic rate (BMR)</li>
  <li>Levels of physical activity</li>  
  <li>thermic effect of food </li> 
</ul>

<p> Now lets not get too scientific here </p>

<p>Your BMR is basically the amount of calories you need to live. Physical activity is obvious and it's the only one you have control over. The thermic effect of food is essentially the amount of calories it takes to digest and absorb food.</p>

<p> Follow along now because there is some math involved. I know, I'm sorry </p>
<p> we are going to calculate how may calories you need daily </p>

<p> These are just some examples. Make sure you plug in the right numbers but now you have a good baseline to start and that is extremely important. Now you can make minor changes to create positive changes in your body.</p>



<h2>2. Create a Caloric Surplus</h2>

<p> Now lets start manipulating our caloric intake. The goal is to build muscle and in order to do that we need a caloric surplus. 1 pound of muscle is approximately 2,500 calories. So in order to put on some muscle you should increase your caloric intake by 300-500 calories per day. That means if we use our male client from above as an example, he should be consuming at least 3,908 calories per day.</p>

 

<h2> 3.Consume Adequate Protein to Build that Muscle</h2>



<p> If you are trying to build some muscle The International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) recommends taking in 1.5-2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. If we use our female example above that is 178 grams of protein a day, but this recommendation is meant for true strength and power athletes, which means they are training 6 days a week for a significant period of time. The recommended Dietary Allowance of protein is 0.8 to 1 gram per kilogram per day may not be enough to build some lean muscle. Ultimately it depends on your goals. If you are only training a moderate amount 1.2- 1.5 grams may be enough for you. Regardless, the quality of protein is important. </p>

<p> This is determined by its amino acid content. Proteins that contain all the essential amino acids (complete proteins)  and in amounts sufficient enough to maintain protein synthesis. Some great examples are dairy products, eggs, meat and fish.</p>

<p> This article could just go on and on about just protein. Just remember to get a sufficient amount of protein and also to use supplementation when it becomes difficult to get it from only food alone.</p>
