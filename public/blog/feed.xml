        <title>3 Diet Tips to Help You Shed That Body Fat</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt; 	First off “Good on you for taking an interest in being more health conscious”.  I Think it’s fairly reasonable to say mostly everyone’s fitness goals are to build as much lean muscle as possible and lose some body fat at the same time. Basically, we want to look good :) We want that summer body, all year round. Hey don’t worry ,I want to look good too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is, there is a ton of bad information out there. Especially, when it comes to nutrition. 
Your nutritional needs are based on your age, gender, lifestyle, level of activity, physical conditioning, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You want that summer body? Good I want you to have it, but lets do it in a healthy way that promotes a positive change in your life. Not in a way that has you dropping a macronutrient or an enormous amount of calories. Lets be smart! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, here are  3 tips to help you shed some body fat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;CARBS, FAT, AND PROTEIN!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not get rid of any of these macronutrients! They are fundamental and your body needs them. Any diet that advocates dropping any of these is unhealthy and unrealistic. We need to make positive choices that become lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, what should you do? Simple, split each nutrient appropriately. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good split to start with is 40% carbs, 30% fat, 30% protein. Now, this can change depending  on your activity level and other variables but it is a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt; Here are Some Examples of Great Choices &lt;/h3&gt;

                                  &lt;/ul&gt;

                &lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Edgerank completely fails to have the effect it was originally designed for nice product. This will be a really interesting post about Facebook&#39;s biggest mistake yet...&lt;/p&gt;


            

        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;


  &lt;/div&gt;    
   &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Create a Caloric Deficit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the key here. If you burn more calories than you take in you will inch closer to reaching the desired body fat you desire. Couple this with some physical activity and you are golden. Remember, its not carbs that are making you gain all that weight it is an excess of calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep track of what you put in your body and burn more calories than you take in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are 3 simple tips that will make a world of difference. Just be consistent and aware of what you put in your body. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Understanding the Roles that Muscles Play in the Body </title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;    
Muscles account for nearly half of the body’s weight and are of interest to many fields of health care and fitness. Regardless of whether or not your occupation is in the health industry, it is important to understand the various roles that muscles play throughout the body in order to aid you in your fitness journey. There are over 600 muscles in the human body. Of these, skeletal muscles make up 215 pairs. The muscles in the body have many properties and roles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Properties of Muscle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excitability:  The muscle’s sensitivity to chemical, electrical, and mechanical stimuli&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Contractility: The ability of the muscle to develop tension or internal force in response to stimuli &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Extensibility:  The muscles ability to be passively and actively stretched beyond its normal resting length.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Elasticity: The muscles ability to return to its resting length after it has been stretch passed its resting length &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Role of Muscles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main role of the muscle is movement. The muscle contracts and it simply attempts to pull the bones. The result is that the less stable bone moves toward the more stable bone which causes movement. Each muscle usually plays various roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Agonist &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agonist is the prime mover meaning it does the majority of work and causes the movement that is desired&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Antagonist &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The antagonist has the opposite effect of the agonist. It causes the opposing muscle to relax in order for the agonist to create movement &lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stabilizers &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stabilizers surround the joint and provide support in order for the body segment to produce force and move &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Synergist &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synergists assist the agonist in movement. They are also known as guiding muscles &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Neutralizers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neutralizers counteract the action of other muscles in order to prevent inappropriate muscle substitutions which can often lead to muscle imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are not the only roles the muscles play in the body (for instance the muscles also provide 85% of one’s body heat) but they are important to know because they are the way the body creates movement and movement is what leads us to better health and wellness.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why is Interval Training so Popular?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt; Interval training is really just one way to perform cardiovascular endurance training. Cardiovascular training is any type of exercise that improves the aerobic efficiency of the human body. Meaning, this type of training improves the ability of the lungs to take in oxygen, transfer it to the blood, and ultimately deliver that oxygen to the working muscles in order to aid in the production of energy. This type of exercise has many benefits, including the ability to perform cardiovascular training in a short amount of time and aiding in weight loss and management. A cardiovascular endurance program will aid weight loss as long as it is properly structured and accompanied by healthy eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; There are many different methods of cardiovascular training: such long slow distance running, pace/tempo training, fartlek training, and interval training. Despite these entire different methods, interval training has become quite popular, but what is interval training?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Basically, interval training involves training at an intensity that is as close to your VO2max as possible. For example, an individual with a good cardiovascular base may perform a sprint at maximum capacity, about 85-95% their max heart rate, for a 30 seconds then go back down to 70-80 percent of their max heart rate for 1 minute. They may continue to cycle at this rate for about 5-15 minutes, which, is very intense on the body. This is not the only way to perform interval training rather it is just a simplistic method of breaking it down. The reason it has become so popular is because it can be done in a relatively short amount of time and it has the potential to burn more calories from fat which of course will aid in weight management. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, when an individual performs intervals it becomes relatively easy to over train the body with such an intense activity. So, ample rest and adequate nutritional intake is necessary between each session of interval training in order to ensure maximum performance and reduce the risk of injury. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;bar&quot;&gt;
&lt;table id=&quot;q-graph&quot;&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Example of interval training program&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td class=&quot;paid bar&quot; style=&quot;height: 120px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;jog&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

        <title>PRINCIPLES OF TRAINING</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
We all have been in a position where we want to get in better shape but we just have no idea where to begin. At Reel Movement you will not only train hard but you will also train smart. That means getting a better understanding of the human body and how it responds to exercise. To better understand how the body reacts to exercise we need to breakdown some basic principles of training. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Principle of overload &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The body constantly adapts to the pressure that is exerted on it. If you intend to continue to see training adaptations you must place additional stress on the body. For example, you can increase the intensity of an exercise by decreasing rest time, adding additional weight, or progressing from a static movement to a dynamic one. It is important that you understand that the intensity should be raised progressively and cautiously in order to prevent overtraining.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Principle of Specificity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The body adapts to the specific demand placed on it. For, example you should not expect to lift heavier weights by running three miles. You should expect to improve at running three miles. If your goal is to improve your cardiovascular system than running is a good approach but if your goal is to improve lean muscle mass resistance training would be the best option. You should include different types of training because they all offer unique adaptations.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Principle of Individualization&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
We are all individuals and thus we have to take into account each person’s response to exercise. There is no exercise program that is one size fits all. Understanding your body is a key principle of training smart. For instance, you may need to remain at a lower intensity program for slightly longer than another individual or you may progress faster. Once you become conscious of your own body you will continue to progress safely and efficiently.

        <title>What is The Core and Why is it Important?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;
Core training has become extremely popular over the past several years, but why is it so important and what are the potential benefits of training the core? The core musculature is not just made up of the rectus abdominus and the internal and external obliques, but a much more extensive network of muscles. The core is broken down into three systems.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Local Stabilization System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The local core stabilizers are muscles that attach directly to the spine and aid in stability in between each vertebra.  Some muscles that comprise the local stabilization system are the transverse abdominus, internal oblique, and the multifidus. This system overall contributes in increasing segmental spinal stability.  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Global Stabilization System &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The muscles of the global stabilization system attach the pelvis to the spine. Some of the major muscles of this system include the quadratus lumborum, psoas major, and the external obliques. Its main function is to provide stability between the pelvis and the spine and transfer loads between the upper and lower extremities. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Movement System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The muscles of this system attach the spine and/or pelvis to the extremities. The movement systems primary muscles are the latissimus dorsi, hip flexors, hamstrings, and quadriceps. When it comes to the core the movement system provides dynamic stabilization when the body is performing functional activities. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;	
The core ultimately provides stabilization throughout the spine and hips allowing for optimum joint movement. A strengthened core reduces the risk of injury, improves function and performance, and improves neuromuscular control and stability. A good core program focuses on function and movement rather than just quantity.  So, in your training regime be sure include some core exercises and watch how much more your performance improves
